# 🌾 Rai AI — 3-Year Lean Marketing & Growth Plan (Unicorn Path)

**Goal:** Build Rai AI into Southeast Asia’s #1 smart-farming assistant app — trusted by farmers, shops, co-ops, and agri-businesses.  
**Timeframe:** 36 months (6-month benchmarks)  
**Core values:** Trust, daily usefulness, viral shareability, and data-driven monetization.

## ⚙️ Core Strategy
| Pillar | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **1. Build daily habits** | Farmers open Rai AI each morning to check “Spray Window” + Prices. |
| **2. Turn usage into word-of-mouth** | Every alert, scan result, or shop visit includes a shareable QR or LINE message. |
| **3. Use real stories, not ads** | Feature real Thai farmers (short clips, quotes, before/after). |
| **4. Keep costs tiny** | Focus on digital + community channels instead of paid ads. |
